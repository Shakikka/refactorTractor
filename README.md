## Overview

This is a Turing School of Software and Design - Module 2 group project.

What's Cookin'? began as a bare-bones starter kit. Over the course of this project, we built out the HTML structure, CSS Grid styling & responsive design, and Javascript functionality from scratch. The project now has three class files, `Recipe.js`, `RecipeRepository.js` & `User.js`, that were each built via Test Driven Development. The app itself hosts a number of recipe objects, displayed to the user and made interactive. Users can navigate through the app, search for recipes to either favorite or add to their lists to cook for the week, take a look at the ingredients in their pantry, or simply browse for recipe information.

## Planning Resources

* [Trello Project Board](https://trello.com/b/oP41W1po/refactor-tractor)
* [Miro Board - Class Structure Outline](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lSqxVCE=/)
* [Wireframe]()


## Set Up

### FitLit API Server

COPY TO DESCRIBE HOW TO RUN THE FITLIT API

### Server

Clone down this repository to your local machine, then install the library dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```


To start the server that hosts the app, run:

```bash
npm start
```

If you see `Compiled successfully` in your terminal, the server is running and the app can be veiwed at `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser. Make sure this server, and the FitLit API server, are both running to ensure you see the right information displayed on the app.

## Wins


* Great organization - we got through everything!
*

## Future Iterations

* Methods were left in each class that we thought had a sound practical purpose, but were not represented on the DOM. These would be great to display in further iterations.
* Implementing icons or buttons to hide or display information when a user clicks on them.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
